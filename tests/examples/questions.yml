# PROMPT 1:
#
# Please could you help me create some fake data?
#
# I would like the data in YAML format.
#
# A question should have properties "text" (the text of the question), "slug" (a short dash-separated version of the question suitable for using in a URL), "has_free_text" (boolean whether or not the question has a free text component), and "multiple_choice_options", which should be a list of three alternatives, or null if there is no multiple choice component.
#
# There should be 10 questions altogether.
# 6 of the questions should have a multiple choice and a free text component.
# 2 of the questions should have only a multiple choice component.
# 2 of the questions should have only a free text component.
#
# All of the questions should be asking about the subject of British chocolate bars. The questions should be open-ended to invite free text answers — for instance "Do you believe that 2 finger Kit Kats are better than 4 finger Kit Kats?". Multiple choice answers should usually be "Yes", "No" or "I don't know".

# PROMPT 2:

# For each of the following questions, please generate 10 responses. Each response should be between 1 and 3 sentences long. Return each set of responses as YAML.
